Plan for Addon (20240909)

#Needed Features
    -import and export (maybe referencing the existing usd import/export function)
    -null (/_geo) for geometry base hierarchy for usd assets
    -(/_materials) gets imported, but empty
    -extra layers (cameras, curves)
    -light layers (all lights)
    -all assets are sorted in the some data structure and readable with other DCCs

#Fazit:
    Simplest way at the moment is that the user selects all assets
    and the script sorts and tags the asset to a corresponding null object.
    Or manually function that the user selects the object and defines the object class
    and clicks the button to tag it.
