Blender USD Manager Addon

This addon should help to get a similar interface and pipeline to the Houdini Solaris. The goal is to get a proper import/export function and have a usd editor for adjusting the hierachy. 

Please feel free to contribute your ideas/functions as well with reaching out. 

Many thanks
