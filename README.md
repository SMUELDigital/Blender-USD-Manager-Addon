# BlenderAddon USD Stage Manager

*Vision* 

This addon should help to get a similar interface and pipeline to the Houdini Solaris. The goal is to get a proper import/export function and have a usd editor for adjusting the hierachy. 

*Present*

At the moment, the addon works with setup the USD Stage Structure inside Blender 4.2 LTS as you might know in SideFX Houdini. Please be aware that there are some known issues indicated with every released version.

*Help/Colab*

Please feel free to contribute your ideas/functions as well with reaching out. 

Many thanks
